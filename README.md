## Description

This project uses OpenCV to perform face detection in real-time using a webcam. The pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier is used to detect faces in the video stream.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using a webcam
- Draws rectangles around detected faces
- Press 'q' to quit the application
